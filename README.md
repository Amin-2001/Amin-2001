ðŸ¤“ I'm a bachelor's student in computer engineering and I'm looking forward to enrolling in a master's degree program in AI right after.

âš¡ HOWEVER, I self-study many topics in CS and beyond, and honestly 90% of everything I know has been learnt through self-study.

ðŸ”® Right now, I'm working on machine learning projects in NLP domain.
